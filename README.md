# Antigravity Quota Refresher

## The Problem

[Google Antigravity IDE](https://antigravity.google) quotas operate on a **5-hour rolling window** (for Google AI Pro / Ultra users). If you use it at 10:00, your quota refreshes at 15:00. For intense coding sessions, this falls a bit short.

## The Solution

Send (automated) minimal LLM prompts to all 3 quota pools (Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 3 Flash, and Claude) hours **before** you work to start the rolling windows → quota refreshes mid-session.

> 💡 Each prompt consumes less than 0.5% of its pool's quota.

### Example Case - Comparison

#### ❌ Without Refresher

You start working at 10:00. Your quota starts draining immediately. **During intense sessions, quota burns much faster than 5 hours** — you might exhaust it in 2 hours. Either way, you're stuck waiting until the 5-hour rolling window expires.

    section Quota
    Quota Rolling Window (5h)                :crit, 10:00, 5h
    ⚠️ Quota might be exhausted early        :milestone, m2, 12:00, 0d

    section Work
    Work Session                             :active, 10:00, 7h
    ⏰ Finally refreshes...                  :milestone, m1, 15:00, 0d
```

> ⚠️ **Problem:** Burn out at 12:00, but you must wait until 15:00 for refresh. **3 hours stuck.**

#### ✅ With Refresher

Trigger fires at 07:00 (before you wake up). That starts rolling window #1. You start working at 10:00. At 12:00, window #1 expires and **you get a fresh quota** — right when you need it.

```mermaid

    title With Refresher
    dateFormat HH:mm
    axisFormat %H:%M
    todayMarker off

    section Bucket 1
    ⚡ API Trigger Fires                     :milestone, t1, 07:00, 0d
    Quota Rolling Window 1 (5h)              :done, 07:00, 5h

    section Bucket 2
    Quota Rolling Window 2 (5h)              :active, 12:00, 5h

    section Work
    Work Session                             :w1, 10:00, 7h
    🔄 Fresh quota!                          :milestone, m1, 12:00, 0d
```

> ✅ **Benefit:** Mid-session refresh at 12:00 instead of 15:00. **3 extra hours of runway.**

| Scenario          | Refresh Happens | If Depleted at 12:00           |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| ❌ Without        | 15:00           | 3 hours stuck waiting          |
| ✅ With Refresher | 12:00           | Already refreshed!             |

This allows you to work longer without worrying about quota depletion.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Highly recommended to deploy this in an always-on VPS (or local machine).

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leonidlouis/antigravity-quota-refresher.git
cd antigravity-quota-refresher
```

### 2. Setup

#### 2a. Authentication Token (Required)

You need to extract your authentication token from the Antigravity IDE.

**Option A: Running Locally (Same machine as IDE)**

If you are running this on the same computer where you use Antigravity IDE:

```bash
# 1. Extract the token
sudo apt install sqlite3 && ./export-token.sh
# (Or via NPM: npm install && npm run export-token)

# 2. Copy the token and save to .env
echo "ANTIGRAVITY_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_token_here" > .env
```

**Option B: Running on VPS (Recommended 24/7)**

Since your VPS likely doesn't have the Antigravity IDE, you must **export the token from your local machine first**.

1. **On Local Machine**:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install sqlite3 && ./export-token.sh
    # (Or via NPM: npm install && npm run export-token)
    ```

2. **On VPS**:

    ```bash
    # Create .env with the copied token
    echo "ANTIGRAVITY_REFRESH_TOKEN=paste_your_token_here" > .env
    ```

#### 2b. Telegram Notifications (Optional)

Get notified on your phone when triggers fire.

1. **Create Bot**: Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram → `/newbot` → copy token
2. **Get Chat ID**:
   - Start a conversation with your new bot (send any message)
   - Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
   - Find `"chat":{"id":123456789}` in the response — that's your Chat ID
3. **Add to .env**:

   ```bash
   echo "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token" >> .env
   echo "TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id" >> .env
   ```

> 💡 The deploy script will also prompt you to set this up interactively.

### 3. Deploy

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

That's it. The script will:

1. ✓ Ask for trigger time & timezone
2. ✓ Optionally set up Telegram (if not already configured)
3. ✓ Start the container with auto-restart
4. ✓ Test your API connection ← happens inside the container on startup

> **Note:** To update your trigger schedule, simply re-run the deploy script at any time.

### 4. Check Status (Optional)

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

It should be fine, but it is still a good idea to monitor whether the logs are healthy.

A good startup looks like this:

![Deploy Logs](docs/deploy-logs.png)

A good cron / scheduler trigger looks like this:

![Trigger](docs/trigger-execution.png)

Done! everyday on _[your configured time]_, your Antigravity Quota rolling window should be started.

## 📱 Telegram Notifications

What you'll receive when triggers fire:

**All pools at 100%:**

```text
✅ Antigravity quota usage triggered at 12:00

📊 Quota before trigger:
• Gemini 3 Pro: 100.00%
• Gemini 3 Flash: 100.00%
• Claude: 100.00%

5hr rolling window started.
Will be fully refreshed at 17:00
```

**Some pools already in use:**

```text
5hr rolling window started.
Partial refresh expected (not all pools were at 100%)
```

**All pools already in active cycle:**

```text
All pools already in active cycle — skipped.
```

**On failure:**

```text
❌ Antigravity quota trigger FAILED

All endpoints failed or are rate-limited.

Manual intervention required.
```
